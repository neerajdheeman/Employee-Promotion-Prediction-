# Employee Promotion Prediction Project
# Introduction
This project aims to predict the promotion of employees in a company. The dataset contains information about the employees such as their performance ratings, education level, previous awards, length of service, etc. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether an employee will be promoted or not.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:

Employee_id,
Department,
Region,
Education,	
Gender,	
Recruitment_channel,	
No_of_trainings,	
Age,	
Previous_year_rating,	
Length_of_service,	
KPIs_met >80%,	
Awards_won?,	
Avg_training_score,	
Is_promoted (target variable)
# Model Building
We will build a binary classification model to predict whether an employee will be promoted or not. The following steps will be followed:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),
Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, etc.)
Feature Selection (identifying important features for the model)
Model Selection (comparing different algorithms and selecting the best one)
Model Evaluation (measuring the performance of the selected model)

# Tools and Libraries
This project will be implemented in Python. The following libraries will be used:

pandas for data manipulation,
NumPy for numerical operations,
scikit-learn for model building and evaluation,
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization. 


# Conclusion
Predicting employee promotions can help companies identify potential leaders and create development plans to retain them. This project aims to build a model that can accurately predict employee promotions and help companies make informed decisions.
